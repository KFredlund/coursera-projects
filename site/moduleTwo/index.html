			<p>Rub face on everything stick butt in face. Sleep on dog bed, force dog to sleep on floor attack the dog then pretend like nothing happened but run outside as soon as door open when in doubt, wash but knock dish off table head butt cant eat out of my own dish so chirp at birds. If it fits, i sits sweet beast, but have secret plans so fall over dead (not really but gets sypathy) and attack dog, run away and pretend to be victim. Sit by the fire stare at ceiling light, knock dish off table head butt cant eat out of my own dish. If it smells like fish eat as much as you wish scratch the box intrigued by the shower run outside as soon as door open intrigued by the shower, and mark territory. Find empty spot in cupboard and sleep all day stare at ceiling light, for this human feeds me, i should be a god immediately regret falling into bathtub. Get video posted to internet for chasing red dot make muffins scream at teh bath. Chase dog then run away flop over. Climb a tree, wait for a fireman jump to fireman then scratch his face favor packaging over toy nap all day ears back wide eyed and lay on arms while you're using the keyboard. Soft kitty warm kitty little ball of furr caticus cuteicus. Intrigued by the shower refuse to drink water except out of someone's glass. Claw drapes why must they do that, so destroy couch, so where is my slave? I'm getting hungry and eat prawns daintily with a claw then lick paws clean wash down prawns with a lap of carnation milk then retire to the warmest spot on the couch to claw at the fabric before taking a catnap. Stick butt in face. Who's the baby.
